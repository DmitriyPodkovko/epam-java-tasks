# Odd values

The purpose of this exercise is to train you to work with the Java 8 streams API.  
The estimated workload is *15 min*.

### Description

Please, proceed to `Task` class and implement its method:

`public static List<String> f(List<Integer> integerList)`

Method must return a list of string representations of only odd `integerList` values. List must be sorted in ascending order.

Parameter:
* `integerList` is a list of positive integer values.

> Also, it is necessary to implement `Task.main` method to demonstrate all the functionality.

### Details

* Function to implement must contain just only one return statement.
* Use one or more  Java 8 stream pipelines to create return value.

### Example

Input:

```
integerList = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8]
```

Output:

```
["1", "3", "5"]
```
